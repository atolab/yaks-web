## Yaks Overview

Yaks provides a **distributed service** that implements an **eventually consistent**, **scalable**,
**location transparent**, **high performance**, and **distributed key/value store** with pluggable back-ends. 

Yaks is equipped with **dynamic discovery** and supports extremely well dynamic environments

Yaks data is **globally accessible** without requiring local replication as in traditional key/value stores.

In a way, Yaks can be thought as a distributed fabric to integrate and data at rest and data in movement
and access it in a location transparent manner.

See the Yaks key abstractions here: [Abstractions](../manual/abstractions).
